                <p>Symphonic Band, Jazz Band, Indie Rock Band, Musical Pit Band... Name it all!
                    My favourite source of joy is playing music with others and performing in front
                    of an audience. The pure sense of euphoria that comes after every rehearsal and show
                    is unmatched. I have a long list of stories to tell from my musical experiences,
                    and I'd like to share a few highlights here.

                <h2>My Journey</h2>
                <p>I could never be the musician I am without my high school Jazz Band.
                    Here is where I learned true grit and dedication. I started off as a
                    beginner drummer, along with another senior year drummer who had professional
                    level experience. I was more than intimidated and always felt that I didn't deserve
                    the spot, but while I was thinking all that, being a drummer was all I ever wanted.
                    I worked harder than I ever knew I could before, and with that, I got better and better
                    until I won multiple awards throughout my high school years. The most memorable award was
                    the WBDI (Women Band Directors International) Award, given to the most outstanding musician
                    in the Calgary Honours Girls in Jazz Band. Jazz drumming helped me experience the beauty
                    of consistency and hard work. No matter how skill-less I was, hard work always paid off.
                </p>
                <p>After such a memorable musical journey in high school, I entered a new musical phase in my life
                    coming to Toronto for my university education.
                    I was fortunate enough to meet friends who shared the same mmusic taste as I did, with
                    the same level of passion, dedication, and skills. We formed an indie rock band called Orion's Belt,
                    and we played gigs around Toronto. I got to experience the most exciting year, 
                    with so many new experiences including recording in a professional studio, playing live gigs
                    to a local audience, and also getting to meet so many talented artists. The Toronto local Band
                    scene is truly an amazing community. It is full of talented, passionate, and creative people, and through
                    them, my appreciation for art as a whole grew so much. The music scene in Toronto wasn't just about music.
                    It was a combination of culture, art, fashion, and lifestyle. I was so lucky to be part of it.
                    Performing and creating music in a band allowed me to experience the joy of collaboration
                    and the thrill of working with like-minded people with a shared goal, and my
                    appreciation for art.
                </p>
                <p>My musical journey continues, and my new station I am currently exploring is 
                    playing in musical pit bands. University of Toronto has an amazing theatre program,
                    and I was lucky enough to be part of the pit band for two musicals: "FootLoose" and "The
                    Guy Who Didn't Like Musicals". Playing in a pit band is a whole new experience
                    compared to playing in a regular band. You have to be extremely precise and to do that
                    it requires a lot of practice. But honestly, I love every bit of it. I've been a casual 
                    musical theatre fan for a long time, and it's been a long dream of mine to be part of a musical production.
                    So not only am I fullfilling my dreams, I get to work with so many super talented musicians.
                    I don't even know how to explain the feeling of euphoria after every rehearsal! I am just so 
                    grateful that I get to play music with such talented people.
